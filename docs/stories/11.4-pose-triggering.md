# Story 11.4: Chat-to-Pose Triggering Logic

**Status:** TODO
**Assignee:** Developer

## Description
Implement the logic in the A2UI frontend to parse `[pose:X]` tags from the incoming message stream and update the agent's visual state accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Regex-based parser for `[pose:X]` in message strings.
- [ ] Logic to select an asset based on the `11.1-expression-mapping.md` convention.
- [ ] Support for variants (random pick between `_01`, `_02` etc. if they exist).
- [ ] Smooth transition (fade/cross-dissolve) between two images.
- [ ] Option to hide the tag `[pose:X]` from the final displayed text.

## Technical Notes
- Use Framer Motion for the `Z-10` layer transitions.
- The `AgentDisplay` component should listen to the event bus or props updates containing these tags.
