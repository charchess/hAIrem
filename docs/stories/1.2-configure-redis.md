## QA Results

### Review Date: 2026-01-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Strong implementation of the H-Link protocol. The Pydantic models precisely match the architecture specification. The async Redis client demonstrates excellent resilience patterns.

### Refactoring Performed
None required. The implementation of exponential backoff is exactly what was requested in the Risk Profile.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: [x] (Asyncio, Pydantic, Logging)
- Project Structure: [x] (Separation of models/infra)
- Testing Strategy: [x] (Integration test provided)
- All ACs Met: [x]

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] In `main.py` (future story), ensure `RedisClient` is initialized with `os.getenv("REDIS_HOST")` to use the Docker values.

### Security Review
- No data validation issues found (Pydantic handles types).
- Redis connection string is built dynamically.

### Performance Considerations
- `ignore_subscribe_counts=True` in `get_message` avoids processing noise.
- `timeout=1.0` in `get_message` is a good balance for the event loop.

### Files Modified During Review
None.
