## QA Results

### Review Date: 2026-01-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Strong implementation of the Agent pattern. The command registration system is flexible and the error handling within the message loop ensures that one failed command doesn't crash the agent.

### Refactoring Performed
None.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: [x] (Async, Pydantic)
- Project Structure: [x] (Domain logic separated)
- Testing Strategy: [x] (Mocked unit tests)
- All ACs Met: [x]

### Improvements Checklist
- [ ] Add a `shutdown` method to `BaseAgent` to gracefully close Redis connections (future story).

### Security Review
- Command execution is explicit (allow-list via `register_command`), preventing arbitrary code execution.

### Files Modified During Review
None.

### Gate Status
