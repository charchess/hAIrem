# Story 11.1: Ekman-based Expression Mapping

**Status:** Done
**Assignee:** PM (John) / UX (Sally)

## Description
Standardize the visual expressions for hAIrem agents based on Paul Ekman's universal emotions and Sally's initial pose set. This mapping will serve as the naming convention for all image assets and chat triggers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Comprehensive list of expression names defined. (Ref: `docs/visual-style-guide.md`)
- [x] Mapping between `[pose:X]` tags and asset filenames established. (Ref: `docs/v1-prompt-library.md`)
- [x] Integration strategy for "Z-10 (Agents)" layer documented. (Ref: `docs/visual-style-guide.md#4. Integration & Post-Processing`)

## Expression Map (Finalized)
| Emotion (Ekman) | Tag / Pose Name | Asset Suffix | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Neutral | `idle` | `_neutral` | Calm, baseline expression |
| Joy | `happy` | `_happy` | Smiling, friendly |
| Sadness | `sad` | `_sad` | Drooping ears/eyes |
| Anger | `angry` | `_angry` | Frowning, sharp eyes |
| Surprise | `alert` | `_alert` | Wide eyes, upright ears |
| Fear | `emergency` | `_emergency` | Tense, worried |
| Disgust | `confused` | `_confused` | Skeptical, one ear tilted |
| - | `thinking` | `_thinking` | Focused, eyes slightly narrowed |
| - | `shy` | `_shy` | Slight blush, looking away |
| - | `glitch` | `_glitch` | Distorted or error state |

## Asset Variation Support
To avoid visual fatigue, each expression can have multiple versions.
Convention: `{agent_name}_{suffix}_{index}.png`
Example: `renarde_shy_01.png`, `renarde_shy_02.png`.

## Technical Implementation
Assets should be stored in `apps/a2ui/public/assets/agents/{agent_name}/`.
The frontend should fallback to `_01` if no index is specified, or pick a random index if multiple are available for a given pose.
