# Epic 11: Expressive Embodiment & Visual Refinement

**Goal:** Transform generic placeholders into high-fidelity, expressive visual assets using Paul Ekman's emotional framework and `nanobanana` generation, while validating dashboard spatialization.

## Status
- [ ] Story 11.1: Ekman-based Expression Mapping (In Progress)
- [ ] Story 11.2: Generation of "High-Fi Placeholders"
- [ ] Story 11.3: Dashboard Spatialization Validation
- [ ] Story 11.4: Chat-to-Pose Triggering (MVP Logic)

## Context
We are using the `nanobanana` extension to generate these assets. The focus is on consistency and emotional resonance to enhance the "A2UI" (Agent-to-User Interface) and the "Living House" concept.
