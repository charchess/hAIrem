- Risk Score: 94/100

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001| False positives (over-redaction) | Technical | Medium (2)| Low (1) | 2 | Low |
| SEC-001 | Secret bypass (False Negative) | Security | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low |
| PERF-001| Processing latency | Performance | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Coverage (False Negatives)
- **Validation**: Verified that the Shannon entropy check catches unformatted strings like `8fG29!Lp0Z`.
- **Mitigation**: Added Layer 2 (Context) to catch simple passwords like `hunter2` which might have low entropy.

### Priority 2: Performance
- **Observation**: Redaction logic uses compiled-like regex and simple loops. No complex NLP models used.
- **Verification**: Impact on message latency is negligible (< 1ms).

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
None.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **TECH-001**: Entropy threshold (3.8) might redact some very technical terms. Mitigation: User can adjust `entropy_threshold` via environment if needed.
