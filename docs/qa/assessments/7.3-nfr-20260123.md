# NFR Assessment: Story 7.3 - Agent Status Dashboard

**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- **Security**: PASS - Only displays agent metadata and public status.
- **Performance**: PASS - Fast rendering with local caching of metadata.
- **Reliability**: PASS - Real-time updates validated.
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Integrated into existing Renderer patterns.

## Detailed Assessment

### Security
**Status: PASS**
- No sensitive agent internal states are exposed.
- Only capabilities/metadata already available to the user are displayed.

### Performance
**Status: PASS**
- Grid layout is responsive and handles dynamic additions well.
- *Recommendation*: If agent count grows beyond 20+, implement virtual scrolling or lazy rendering.

### Reliability
**Status: PASS**
- Status updates (`system.status_update`) use the same robust WebSocket bridge as narrative text.
- Verified transition consistency via E2E testing.

### Maintainability
**Status: PASS**
- Use of a central `agents` state object in `Renderer` makes state management predictable.

## Quick Wins
- Add a "Last Updated" timestamp to the dashboard header (~15 mins).
- Improve role descriptions (currently hardcoded as "Agent [Name]") (~30 mins).
