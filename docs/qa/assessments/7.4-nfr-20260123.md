## Detailed Assessment

### Security
**Status: PASS**
- Only UI state (`stage` vs `dashboard`) is stored in `localStorage`.

### Performance
**Status: PASS**
- CSS `opacity` and `transition` properties are GPU-accelerated.
- No heavy re-renders during view switching.

### Reliability
**Status: PASS**
- Smooth handling of page reloads.
- Graceful failure if `localStorage` is missing (defaults to Stage).

### Maintainability
**Status: PASS**
- `switchView` method provides a clean API for adding new views in the future.

## Quick Wins
None. Implementation is solid.
