# Risk Profile: Story 7.2 - Real-time System Logs View

Date: 2026-01-23
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 86/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Logging Recursion Loop

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - The bridge logging its own activity to the system log handler.
**Impact**: High (3) - Can crash the server or exhaust resources/disk space rapidly.
**Mitigation**:
- Implementation of `ignored_loggers` list in `RedisLogHandler`.
- Use of a dedicated `bridge_logger` that is explicitly ignored.
**Testing Focus**: Continuous operation for 5+ minutes while streaming logs.

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001| Logging recursion loop | Technical | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High |
| PERF-001| DOM bloat in UI | Performance | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low |
| SEC-001 | Exposure of sensitive data | Security | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| OPS-001 | Redis connection failure | Operational | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **Recursion check**: Triggered multiple logs and monitored `debug_quinn.log` for runaway growth. Verified `bridge` logger is ignored.

### Priority 2: Standard Functional Tests
- E2E validation of log arrival and color coding.
- UI interaction (Clear/Pause).

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **TECH-001**: Mitigated by `ignored_loggers` logic. Verified in `main.py`.
- **PERF-001**: Accepted for now. Future recommendation: implement a max line limit (e.g., 500 lines) in the UI viewer.
