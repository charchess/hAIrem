# NFR Assessment: Story 10.2 - The Entropy Agent (Dieu)

**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- **Security**: PASS - Dynamic imports are scoped to the `agents/` directory.
- **Performance**: PASS - No impact on standard messaging latency.
- **Reliability**: PASS - Fallback logic in PluginLoader preserves system stability.
- **Modularity**: EXCELLENT - Follows Thin Orchestrator principles perfectly.

## Detailed Assessment

### Security
**Status: PASS**
- **Validation**: `importlib` uses full paths. 
- **Risk**: A malicious `logic.py` could execute code.
- **Mitigation**: Agents are trusted local components. For multi-tenant cloud, this would need a sandbox (Wasm/Docker).

### Performance
**Status: PASS**
- The boredom check runs once per minute in the background scheduler.
- Whispers trigger a standard LLM inference cycle.

### Reliability
**Status: PASS**
- If `logic.py` fails to load, `PluginLoader` falls back to `BaseAgent`. The system does not crash.

### Maintainability
**Status: EXCELLENT**
- Proactivity is now a "Feature as a Plugin". To disable it, just remove the `agents/entropy` folder.

## Quick Wins
- Use a safer import method or a dedicated namespace for dynamic plugins (~1h).
