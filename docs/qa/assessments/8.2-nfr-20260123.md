**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- **Security**: PASS - History restricted to local session for now.
- **Performance**: PASS - Lightweight REST API call for history.
- **Reliability**: PASS - Graceful handling of empty history.
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Clean separation of concerns.

## Detailed Assessment

### Security
**Status: PASS**
- Currently, `GET /api/history` returns the global history (or last 50).
- *Future Warning*: Once multi-user support is added, this MUST be scoped to the authenticated user.

### Performance
**Status: PASS**
- Fetching 50 records from SurrealDB 2.x is nearly instantaneous.
- JSON response is small.

### Reliability
**Status: PASS**
- Handled empty database scenario successfully during initial implementation.

### Maintainability
**Status: PASS**
- Frontend integration uses existing `Renderer` patterns.

## Quick Wins
- Add pagination support to `GET /api/history` (~1h).
