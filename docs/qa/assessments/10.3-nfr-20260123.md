# NFR Assessment: Story 10.3 - Cross-Agent Collaboration

**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- **Security**: PASS - Internal notes are strictly server-side.
- **Performance**: PASS - Lightweight Redis messaging.
- **Reliability**: PASS - Fault-tolerant tool execution.
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Generic tool available to all `BaseAgent` subclasses.

## Detailed Assessment

### Security
**Status: PASS**
- **Validation**: `agent.internal_note` is not in the whitelist of types pushed to the A2UI WebSocket.
- **Result**: Private collaboration stays private.

### Performance
**Status: PASS**
- Each internal note is a single Redis `PUBLISH` operation.
- LLM overhead is only incurred when the receiving agent is subsequently triggered.

### Reliability
**Status: PASS**
- Error handling in `_process_command` ensures that if an internal note fails to send, the sending agent remains stable.

### Maintainability
**Status: PASS**
- Any new agent plugin automatically inherits the `send_internal_note` tool.

## Quick Wins
- Implement a `max_collab_depth` setting in the system config to prevent complex loops (~30min).
