## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001| Incompatible tool schemas | Technical | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| SEC-001 | Key leakage via logs | Security | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low |
| PERF-001| High latency on Cloud | Performance | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Authentication
- **Validation**: Verified that specific keys (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) are correctly injected into the environment for LiteLLM.
- **Verification**: Confirmed successful response from Gemini 2.5 Flash in E2E tests.

### Priority 2: Security
- **Observation**: Checked `main.py` and `llm.py` logs. Verified that API keys are NOT printed in clear text during normal operation.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
None.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **TECH-001**: LiteLLM handles schema translation. We should verify tool calling for *each* new provider added.
