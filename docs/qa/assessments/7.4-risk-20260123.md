## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001| Inconsistent view state | Technical | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| USAB-001| Confusing view transition | Usability | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| TECH-002| LocalStorage quota/fail | Technical | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Persistence
- **Validation**: Verified state persistence across reloads using `tests/validate_epic_7.py`. 
- **Observation**: `localStorage` correctly stores and restores the `hairem_active_view` key.

### Priority 2: Visual Transitions
- **Validation**: Observed smooth 0.5s fade transitions. Verified that no "ghost" interactions (pointer-events) remain on hidden elements.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
None.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **TECH-001**: Mitigated by centralized `switchView` method in `Renderer`.
