**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)

## Risk Matrix

| Risk Factor | Probability (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Score | Mitigation |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Logic Error in Filtering** | 2 | 3 | 6 | Level mapping is standard; verified by string matching. |
| **WebSocket Flood on Change** | 1 | 2 | 2 | Throttled by UI interaction (dropdown change). |
| **Unauthorized Config Change** | 2 | 4 | 8 | Future Story: Add RBAC. Currently low risk in dev env. |
| **UI/State Out of Sync** | 3 | 2 | 6 | LocalStorage syncs on connect. |

**Average Risk Score:** 5.5 (Low-Medium)

## Mitigation Strategy
- Ensure backend handles invalid log level strings gracefully (Standardized in review).
- Recommend RBAC for production-ready versions.
- Added broadcast confirmation for better observability across clients.
