## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001| Circular whispers | Technical | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| NAR-001 | Repetitive proactivity | Narrative | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low |
| SEC-001 | Dynamic import vulnerability| Security | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Modular Loading
- **Validation**: Verified that `PluginLoader` correctly handles agents WITH and WITHOUT `logic.py`.
- **Verification**: Confirmed that `Expert-Domotique` (standard) and `Dieu` (custom) both load without conflicts.

### Priority 2: Message Routing
- **Observation**: Checked that `system.whisper` is published to `agent:{target}` and NOT broadcasted.
- **Verification**: This prevents all agents from talking at once when Dieu whispers.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
None.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **TECH-001**: Dieu could theoretically whisper to himself if added to the target list. 
- **Mitigation**: The target list in `logic.py` is currently hardcoded to exclude Dieu. In V3.1, this should be dynamic based on `agent_registry`.
