**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- **Security**: PASS - Proper handling of env-based secrets.
- **Performance**: PASS - LiteLLM adds minimal overhead.
- **Reliability**: PASS - Unified exception mapping implemented.
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Drastic reduction in provider-specific code.

## Detailed Assessment

### Security
**Status: PASS**
- Integration follows "Isolation stricte" standard.
- Env vars used for all sensitive keys.

### Performance
**Status: PASS**
- Direct streaming preserved.
- Latency depends on provider, but the bridge overhead is negligible.

### Reliability
**Status: PASS**
- **Validation**: Handled 404 and 401 errors gracefully during the "trial and error" phase of implementation.
- Polyfill for missing `v1beta` models worked automatically via LiteLLM.

### Maintainability
**Status: PASS**
- Switching models now requires ZERO code changes.
- Future-proof for new LLMs (Claude 3.5, GPT-5, etc.).

## Quick Wins
None. Refactoring was thorough.
