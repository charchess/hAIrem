## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001| Out-of-sync status | Technical | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| PERF-001| Excessive DOM updates | Performance | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| USAB-001| UI overlap with logs | Usability | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Status Sync
- **Validation**: Verified real-time transitions (IDLE -> THINKING -> IDLE) using `tests/validate_7_3.py`. 
- **Observation**: UI correctly reflects state changes broadcasted via WebSocket.

### Priority 2: UI Integrity
- **Validation**: Checked dashboard toggle and keyboard shortcuts. 
- **Recommendation**: Ensure dashboard doesn't obscure the chat input if opened during active interaction.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
None.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **USAB-001**: Dashboard has high Z-index (150). It intentionally covers other elements for focus. Toggle 'D' is easy to use.
