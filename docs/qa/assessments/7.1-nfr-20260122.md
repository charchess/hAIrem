**Story:** 7.1 - Slash Commands Contextual Help (UX)

## Validation Results

| Attribute | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Security** | PASS | Endpoint `/api/agents` returns non-sensitive metadata only. |
| **Performance** | PASS | UI lookup is local and fast. Metadata fetched once. |
| **Reliability** | PASS | Logic handles missing agents or empty lists gracefully. |
| **Maintainability** | CONCERNS | Autocomplete logic is inlined in `renderer.js` `onload`. Could be extracted. |
| **Usability** | PASS | Keyboard navigation and Tab completion verified. |

## Recommendations
- **Maintainability:** Extract Autocomplete logic to a dedicated class in `apps/a2ui/js/autocomplete.js`.
- **Usability:** Add tooltips or descriptions for commands in the suggestion menu.
