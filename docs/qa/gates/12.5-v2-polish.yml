title: V2 Polish (Logs, Timestamps, Addressing)
status: PASS
date: 2026-01-25
reviewer: Quinn
summary: |
  Comprehensive polish pass completed. Addressing logic is now robust and handles natural language mentions. 
  Cacophony issues resolved by strict filtering and context deduplication. 
  Dashboard observability improved with startup broadcasts.
  Non-personified agents (Dieu) no longer interfere with visual layers.
  RAG infrastructure restored and verified.
risks: Low. Addressing heuristics rely on a hardcoded agent list which may need dynamic injection in V3.
nfr_assessment:
  performance: PASS (Addressing filtering reduces LLM calls)
  observability: PASS (Configurable logs and dashboard presence)
  reliability: PASS (Asset fallbacks prevent broken UI states)
