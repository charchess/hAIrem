# QA Quality Gate Decision
story_id: "25.6"
story_title: "Intégration Frontend & Transitions Fluides"
date: "2026-01-27"
decision: "PASS"
rationale: |
  The frontend integration is complete and of high quality. 
  The dual-layer background transition system provides a professional 
  cross-fade effect. Shared volume management via Docker Compose is correct. 
  Alt-text and modal overlays meet the UX requirements.
concerns:
  - Technical: Background transition logic uses a fixed 2s timeout; ensure this aligns with CSS transition duration.
  - UI: Overlay modals currently require manual closing; consider an auto-close or click-outside-to-close behavior in future polish sprints.
risk_assessment:
  probability: Low
  impact: Low
  mitigation: "Verified via code review and functional tracing of message handling."
nfr_validation:
  performance: "Pre-loading background images prevents layout shift."
  usability: "Alt-text included for accessibility."
