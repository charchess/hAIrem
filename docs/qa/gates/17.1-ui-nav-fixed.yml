summary: |
  Story 17.1 is verified. The initial rendering failure was identified as a syntax error in renderer.js (placeholders left by developer). 
  This has been fixed. Live audit via Playwright confirms:
  - Icon-based navigation is correctly placed and styled.
  - Crew panel correctly lists agents and supports toggling.
  - Admin panel shell is ready for 17.2.
  - Click-outside and Escape key close mechanisms work perfectly.
risks: None.
nfr_assessment:
  usability: PASS (Modern icon navigation and modal patterns)
  stability: PASS (Resolved syntax errors and ensured clean class initialization)
