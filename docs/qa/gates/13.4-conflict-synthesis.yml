decision: PASS
rationale: |
  Conflict resolution is implemented as a proactive service (ConflictResolver) integrated into the consolidation cycle.
  The 0.85 similarity threshold provides a good balance for detecting potential contradictions.
  The LLM prompt for synthesis correctly handles OVERRIDE and MERGE actions.
  Tests confirm that contradicting facts trigger synthesis while complementary ones do not.
risks:
  - High LLM costs if too many conflicts are detected.
  - False positives in conflict detection (threshold sensitivity).
requirements_traceability:
  AC1: Conflict detection via semantic search (0.85). [OK]
  AC2: LLM Synthesis loop with resolution prompt. [OK]
  AC3: Graph update (Merge/Override) implemented. [OK]
