# QA Quality Gate Decision
story_id: "25.3"
story_title: "Orchestration Proactive 'A Priori'"
date: "2026-01-27"
decision: "PASS"
rationale: |
  Story 25.3 is a highly successful implementation of proactive background services. 
  The 'Dreamer' component correctly utilizes environmental context (weather, sun state) 
  to prepare assets during idle periods. 
  Importantly, the implementation included a project-wide standardization of 
  embedding dimensions to 1536D, resolving earlier technical debt.
concerns:
  - Technical: High dependency on Home Assistant API for contextual richness.
  - Testing: Fallback logic for time-of-day is tested, but can be improved with time-freezing mocks.
risk_assessment:
  probability: Low
  impact: Medium
  mitigation: "Reliable fallback logic to local system time and generic weather implemented."
nfr_validation:
  performance: "Generation runs during sleep cycles, minimizing impact on real-time interactions."
  maintainability: "Standardized vector dimensions (1536D) simplify future semantic integrations."
