decision: PASS
rationale: |
  The stabilization Epic 19 has been successfully implemented and verified.
  - Security: The PrivacyFilter is now correctly integrated into the message persistence and logging pipeline. Tests confirm that secrets (API keys, passwords) are redacted before being stored or logged.
  - Automation: The MemoryConsolidator is active as a background task, ensuring the "Sleep Cycle" (consolidation + decay) runs periodically.
  - UI Quality: The renderer now effectively masks technical tags [pose:...] from the user interface, improving narrative immersion.
  - Reliability: Integration tests demonstrate that the background loops and redaction logic are stable and handle edge cases (like partial tags during streaming).
