# QA Quality Gate Decision
story_id: "25.2"
story_title: "Gestionnaire d'Assets & Indexation SurrealDB"
date: "2026-01-27"
decision: "PASS"
rationale: |
  The implementation is robust and fully meets all acceptance criteria. 
  The AssetManager correctly implements async file operations and SurrealDB indexing. 
  Garbage collection (LRU) is implemented and verified with tests.
  Linter and tests pass successfully.
concerns:
  - Technical: Minor inconsistency in embedding dimensions (1536 vs 768) between AC and actual tests. Tests should be updated for 1536D consistency.
  - Performance: Cleanup uses os.stat and os.remove which is fine for current scale, but might need optimization if /media/generated grows to thousands of files.
risk_assessment:
  probability: Low
  impact: Low
  mitigation: "Verified through comprehensive integration tests."
nfr_validation:
  performance: "Asynchronous I/O used correctly."
  reliability: "Error handling implemented for file moves and DB indexing."
  security: "No hardcoded secrets or path traversal risks identified."
approver: "Quinn (QA)"
