decision: PASS
rationale: |
  The decay algorithm is correctly implemented in both the infrastructure (SurrealDbClient) and the domain (MemoryConsolidator).
  Unit tests in `apps/h-core/tests/test_decay.py` confirm that the mathematical decay and the reinforcement logic (boost) behave as expected.
  The use of `math::exp` in SurrealDB provides a natural exponential decay.
  The cleanup logic properly removes relationships without deleting the underlying facts, which is crucial for multi-agent knowledge sharing.
risks:
  - High decay rates could lead to premature forgetting of important facts.
  - Mitigation: The DECAY_RATE environment variable allows fine-tuning without code changes.
requirements_traceability:
  AC1: Metadata fields present in BELIEVES edge. [OK]
  AC2: Decay function implemented and callable via MemoryConsolidator. [OK]
  AC3: Reinforcement logic integrated into BaseAgent.recall_memory. [OK]
