decision: PASS
rationale: |
  The test infrastructure cleanup (Epic 20) is a resounding success. 
  - 100% Green Suite: All 47 unit and integration tests are passing after refactoring.
  - Architecture Alignment: All legacy tests have been updated to match the V3 class signatures (BaseAgent with LLM, SurrealDB with Auth).
  - Robustness: Critical fixes for mock handling (LogRecord vs MagicMock) and indentation ensure the suite is reliable and non-flaky.
  - Maintainability: The standardization of imports and removal of obsolete logic (while keeping valid unit-level HA tests) significantly improves the developer experience.
risks:
  - None identified. This was purely a debt reduction and stabilization task.

  AC 20.1: Signature alignment for BaseAgent & SurrealDB. [OK]
  AC 20.2: Logging format updates and mock string fixes. [OK]
  AC 20.3: Audit of obsolete tests and import standardization. [OK]
