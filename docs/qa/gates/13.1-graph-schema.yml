title: Graph Schema Implementation
status: PASS
date: 2026-01-25
reviewer: Quinn
summary: |
  The graph schema has been successfully implemented and verified in the live SurrealDB instance. 
  Relationships (BELIEVES, ABOUT) are correctly established using the RELATE syntax. 
  Unit tests pass, and manual live insertion confirms data integrity. 
  Minor syntax adjustment was made to the ABOUT edge for SurrealDB 2.x compatibility.
risks: Low. The migration script was tested with an empty dataset but logic matches the insert_graph_memory implementation.
nfr_assessment:
  scalability: PASS (Graph indexing via MTREE for embeddings included)
  reliability: PASS (SCHEMAFULL used for edges)
