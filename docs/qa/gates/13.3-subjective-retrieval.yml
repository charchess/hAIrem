decision: PASS
rationale: |
  Subjective retrieval is successfully implemented using SurrealDB graph traversals.
  The query correctly filters for facts believed by the specific agent OR the universal 'system' user.
  The implementation in `SurrealDbClient.semantic_search` correctly handles the `agent_id` parameter.
  The `BaseAgent` correctly injects its identity into the call, fulfilling the abstraction requirement.
requirements_traceability:
  AC1: Subjective query path (agent->BELIEVES->fact). [OK]
  AC2: Universal facts (agent:system) included in results. [OK]
  AC3: Strength filtering (> 0.3) applied in query. [OK]
  AC4: Automatic ID injection by BaseAgent. [OK]
