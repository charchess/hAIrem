# Story 10-4: System Stimulus/Entropy

**Status:** backlog

## Story

As an Agent,
I want to receive system stimuli,
So that I can act proactively without user input.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [AC1] Given system stimuli exist, when generated, then agents can receive them
2. [AC2] Given stimuli trigger actions, when executed, then results are logged
3. [AC3] Given stimuli cause too many actions, when threshold reached, then rate limiting applies

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement entropy/stimuli generator
- [ ] Task 2: Add action triggering
- [ ] Task 3: Add rate limiting

## Dev Notes

- To be implemented in Sprint 22
- Also known as "The Entropy Agent" or "Dieu/L'Étincelle"
- Generates proactive interactions based on context

## File List

- apps/h-core/src/domain/entropy.py (to be created)

## Status: backlog
